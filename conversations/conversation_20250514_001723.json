A small wave or swell is visible in the mid-distance, with the far shoreline and city skyline faintly visible.\n\nThe audio contains sounds of paddling, the surfer remarking again \"Dude, people are dicks here. Damn,\" and then \"I'm so warm, too.\" He also says, \"Did we break anything? I think we just hit our fin,\" suggesting he hit the fin on something or during a fall. Later he says, \"Oh, I'm hot. I'm actually hot,\" and \"Oh, it looks so sick,\" possibly referring to the view or conditions. There's a sound of the camera being submerged briefly.\n\nThis segment seems to be more paddling and recovery after a fall, rather than active surfing. I will view the final part of this video, from 00:02:30 to 00:02:53.\n"
